    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <pre style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">
        The analysis performed through this project was on a comprehensive dataset 
        containing information on fire statistics from 2000 to 2024 from the Oregon 
        Department of Forestry. The aim of this analysis is to study the prevalence 
        of fires across a variety of different causes, across different land ownership
        types, and provide a general understanding of the distribution of fires across
        Oregon to provide insights into the dynamics of wildfires.

    <h2>Analysis</h2>
    <pre style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">
      The chart of the number of fires by each cause of fire eludes that lightning is the highest risk for wildfires,
      followed by ruralist playing and recreationist causes. This analysis, coupled with the following graph showing the highest
      number of fires occure in rural residential areas, and industrial areas allow for an understanding of what are the 
      most commen causes of fires within these two areas and how it compares to fires in general. In rural residential areas,
      the largest cause for fire is ruralist paying, which provides information into lightning not being a control factor in these
      areas. This means there are not precaustions that can be taken that have not already in order to prevent wildfires, 
      resulting in a lower priortiy for wildfire mitigation. Though there is a higher rate of fires caused by ruralist paying,
      allowing for further research into the preventative measures in this scope. In the industrial areas, the highest cause 
      for wildfires includes both lightning as well as recreationist. Therefore, fire mitigation tasks and projections can 
      be made for these two sectors when understanding how to preventing the most commen fire causes. In comparison to the 
      map it can be seen there is a higher ratio of the fires on the west coast of Oregon, through central Oregon, and slightly 
      higher in north eastern Oregon, compared to southeastern Oregon. This information can provide specific hotspots for wildfires, 
      and priority regions for wildfire mitigation.
